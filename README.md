  year         = 2022,
  publisher    = {Zenodo},
  version      = {1.0.0},
  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.6962930},
  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6962930}
}
```

To run the code, first install the requirements via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then download and extract the COVYT dataset.
When running `run.sh`, you need to specify the downloaded data and an output directory for your experiments.
